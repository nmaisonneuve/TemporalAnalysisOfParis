- overlapping
not during the generation (removed according to grad/prob) 
but after the KNN process to keep the higher 
ranked candidates between a pair of overlapping patches

- overlapping when scales are different (purity or scale as priority?)

- purity (satisfactory criteria i.e. "pure enough")
local  / not global discrimination criteria 
measure higly depending of size of the positive images + number of KNN parameters
