The class WFilter provides utilities to compute the whitening of feature 
patches. I precomputed the whitening matrix for HOGs (31 dimensions) on 
PASCAL 2012.

To whiten patches do:

>> load('WF.mat');
>> whitened_patch = WF.filter2classifLDA(your_patch);

The first call to WF.filter2classifLDA is slow as it computes the whitening 
matrix for a specific patch size and cache it. The successive calls will be
faster. Thus you should make sure you process all patches of the same size in a row.

To compute a new general whitening matrix just do:

>> WF = WFilter(max_filter_size, @your_feature_function);
>> WF.processDirectory('path_to_image_folder');

or:

>> WF.processImage(image_matrix);

- max_filter_size has 2 elements [y x]: it is the maximum patch size you aim to
whiten.
- your_feature_function: is the function returning your features. It should take
a color image matrix of type double and return a struct with a field 'feat' 
which should be a cell containing your features at different scales.
